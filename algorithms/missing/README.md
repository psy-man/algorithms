**Missing number in array from 1 to N**

Takes an unsorted array of unique numbers (ie. no repeats)
from 1 through some number n,
and returns the missing number in the sequence
(there are either no missing numbers, or exactly one missing number).

O(N)


```
missing([4, 2, 3]); // 1
missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // undefined
```
